# City-of-Manhattan-KS-Housing-Dashboard

This project introduces an interactive housing dashboard tailored for the City of Manhattan, Kansas, aiming to provide 
local decision-makers with a comprehensive overview of the housing market. By combining data from diverse sources, the 
dashboard offers insights into recent trends, development hurdles, and housing availability by type and income range. A focal point 
of the visualization is its portrayal of housing affordability across Manhattan's neighborhoods, facilitating targeted interventions 
and informed policy decisions. Through this initiative, the paper demonstrates the utility of centralized data visualization in 
empowering stakeholders to address housing challenges effectively.

INSIGHT NEEDS:-

1. Housing Affordability and Trends: Understanding how housing 
affordability varies across different neighborhoods in Manhattan. This 
includes tracking trends in homeownership and rental markets over 
time to identify areas where intervention is needed to improve housing 
affordability.

2. Demographic and Economic Data Integration: Integrating 
diverse data sets such as employment, commuting patterns, and 
demographic information to provide a holistic view of the housing 
market. This can help in understanding how economic and 
demographic factors influence housing demand and affordability.

3. Community Needs and Preferences: Gathering insights on the 
preferences and needs of different demographic groups, including 
preferences for types of housing (e.g., mixed-use, single-family, 
townhouses) and understanding the distribution of housing by income 
levels. This helps in tailoring housing policies and developments to 
meet community needs effectively.

4. Visualization of Data for Stakeholder Engagement: Creating 
visualizations that are not only informative but also engaging for 
stakeholders, facilitating easier comprehension of complex data. This 
includes using interactive maps, bar charts, and other graphical 
representations to make data accessible to non-experts.

5. Policy Impact Analysis: Providing insights that can guide policy 
decisions, such as zoning laws, housing subsidies, and development 
incentives. The dashboard aims to highlight areas that require policy 
intervention and to monitor the impact of existing policies on the 
housing market.

6. Scalability and Future Enhancements: Identifying opportunities 
for expanding the dashboardâ€™s capabilities, such as incorporating 
predictive analytics or extending the geographic scope to include 
surrounding areas. This involves considering how the dashboard can 
evolve over time to continue meeting the needs of the community.

7. User Interaction and Feedback: Ensuring the dashboard allows 
for user interaction and feedback to continually improve its utility and 
relevance. This involves creating mechanisms for stakeholders to 
provide input on what data and visualizations are most useful for their 
needs.
